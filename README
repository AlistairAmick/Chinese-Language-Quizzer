Chinese-Language-Quizzer

by Alistair Amick

---

This is a game that quizzes the player on their knowledge of basic mandarin Chinese. I made this for my mother's Mandarin Chinese language class as a way to get the kids more interested in their coursework. The quizzes and lessons are designed specifically around said coursework. I made this as a first "real project" in any language, with less than a month of learning Python.
